// TODO: Write code to define and export the Intern class.  HINT: This class should inherit from Employee.
//The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:
    //name
    //id
    //email
    //getName()
    //getId()
    //getEmail()
    //getRole()—returns 'Employee'
//In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:
    //school
    //getSchool()
    //getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
